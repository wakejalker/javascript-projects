    <ol>
      <li>I think playing with code is fun</li>
      <li>I spend a lot of time on the internet and want to help make it a fun place to be</li>
      <li>I love watching things come to life</li>

    <p>I would like to refine my current portfolio site with my newfound web development superpowers. I currently rely on my Adobe subscription to keep my portoflio site alive and looking the way it does, but it would be wonderful to take control of that and not have to rely on Adobe/Behance for my content. Plus I can add in a section about how I am learning to code.</p>
